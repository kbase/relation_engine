definitions:
  SourceFieldDefinition:
    description: |
      Describes an individual source metadata field
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    required: [ id, type, label, tooltip, description ]
    properties:
      id:
        description: |
          An identifier for the source; must be unique within the set of
          fields for a source
        type: string
      type:
        $ref: "#definitions/SourceFieldDataType"
      label:
        description: Used to display a label for the field in interfaces and reports
        type: string
      tooltip:
        description: A short description of the field, suitable for a popup "tooltip" in an interface
        type: string
      description:
        description: |
          A full description of the field, suitable for display in a scrolling area.
          May utilize "markdown" markup
        type: string
  SourceFieldDataType:
    description: |
      A type identifier for an additional data source metadata field.
      Some of the scalar types are identifiable (string, boolean, number)
      as generally JSON compatible types.
      Sequences are recorded as "array<type>" where "array" is fixed, and the
      type id within the pointy brackets need not be separately defined.
      There is no enforcement of this syntax, it is just a convention; the
      string itself serves as the type id.
      Specialized types like "sequence" should be utilized if they need special
      treatment, even if another type already provides the same storage type.
    type: string
    enum:
      - string
      - number
      - boolean
      - array<string>
      - array<alias>
      - array<synonym>
      - sequence
  DataSource:
    title: Data Source
    description: |
      A description of an external data source.
      Data sources are external entities, usually governed and managed by an organization,
      with data repositories, data policies, and specific data structures.
      (e.g. taxonomy, ontology), individual data sources may provide data beyond this
      general structure; the data source definition must provide a description
      of those additional fields so that they can be utilized by interfaces.
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    required:
      - ns
      - type
      - title
      - short_title
      - data_url
      - home_url
      - logo_url
      - license
      - item_link
      - citation
      - additional_fields
    properties:
      ns:
        type: string
        format: regex
        pattern: "^[a-z0-9]+(?:[a-z0-9_]*[a-z0-9])*$"
        description: |
          The RE namespace id for the data source; accepts forms composed of
          lower case alphabeti characters, numeric characters and _; underscore
          not allowed at the begin or end; at least one character in length.
