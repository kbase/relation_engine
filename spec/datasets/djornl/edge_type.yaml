    description: "GeneA connects to GeneB if their protein products have been shown to bind to interact with each other, typically through experimental evidence. The PPI-6merged network is the union of 6 different A.thaliana PPI networks: AraNet2 LC, AraNet2 HT, AraPPInet2 0.60, BIOGRID 4.3.194 physical, AtPIN, Mentha. These 6 were all relatively high scoring with GOintersect. StringDB scored badly so was not included"
