  type: object
  description: Template for a vertex entry in the RDP taxonomy tree.
  required: [id, name, rank, molecule, unclassified, incertae_sedis]
  properties:
    id:
      type: string
      description: RDP Taxon id. For a non-sequence node, this is the rank joined
        with ':' and the taxon name with spaces and slashes replaced by underscores.
        If the node is an incertae sedis insertion, ':is' is appended. For a sequence (e.g. leaf)
        node, it is the locus ID.
      examples: ['phylum:Actinobacteria', 'S000494589']
    name:
      type: string
      description: The name of the taxon. For sequences this is the strain name. Some sequences
        in RDP have no name, in which case the name will be an empty string. 
        If '[ _][Ii]ncertae[ _][Ss]edis' exists in the name for internal nodes, that
        text is removed and the node is marked as an incertae sedis node (see below).
      examples: ['Acidimicrobium', 'uncultured bacterium; YRM60L1D06060904']
    rank:
      type: string
      title: Taxonomic rank. Sequence node rank is always 'sequence_example'. 
      examples: [domain, sequence_example]
    molecule:
      type: ['string', 'null']
      description: The type of molecule for the RDP sequence. Either 16S or 28S. Null
        for non-leaf nodes.
      examples: [16S, 28S]
    unclassified:
      type: boolean
      description: Denotes an sequence that does not have a full lineage. In the RDP files,
        these sequence are denoted via a truncated linage string where the last entry starts
        with the string 'unclassified_'. The lineage string is a list of tuples of rank and name
        all separated by semicolons, so if there are an odd number of entries in the lineage
        string an unclassified organism is expected. Always false for internal nodes.
    incertae_sedis:
      type: ['boolean', 'null']
      description: Denotes a taxa node that is an inceratae sedis insertion. Always null for
        sequence (e.g. leaf) nodes.
